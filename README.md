# Camera-KMatrix-Optimisation
MATLAB code for estimating and optimising the KMatrix of a camera from a number of images (nImages >= 3)

# Background 
This code was built as part of coursework at the University of Oxford. The highest level script is 'RunOptimiseKMatrix.m', with the grunt work done through function calls.

# The Work 
The code should run without bugs, though parts of the problem are randomly initialised and as such a solution cannot be guaranteed each time. Though I've tried to annotate the code as well as I can, it may still be difficult to follow without context. For that reason, I have attached my project report as  a PDF, which I hope is helpful.

This was my first significant coding project, and my first experience with optimisation, hence the edges could be a bit rough!
